    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>By names I'm called Ramza Reseni, for my education I did Sunshine Secondary School, and completed last year. I decided to do programming classes because I know hardware and alot about technology (which is my passion) but I also wanted to know how to speak to the machines I love so much, so coming to Moringa School is to understand the language that computers speak</p>
