    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="col-md-10">
      <p>My name is Ramza Reseni, I studied in Sunshine Secondary School, and completed in 2017. I decided to do programming classes because I know much about hardware and alot about technology (which is my passion) and I also wanted to know how to speak to the machines and learn their language, so I came to Moringa School to understand the language they speak and understand them more!</p>
